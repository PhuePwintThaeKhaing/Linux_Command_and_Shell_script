Question 

I am a window user.Thus I tried to install ubuntu distro on VM virtual box but my computer can not install because of my CPU processor. My computer CPU processor is pentium quad core processor. And I tried to install other distro like centos but can not install. But I can run echo command using git bush command prompt. Thus I can test echo command very well. But after creating .sh file on project how can I run .sh file.?
What software is available to run script file?
Is it ok to write shell script file without using linux os?
